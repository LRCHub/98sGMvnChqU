```lrc
[00:20.47] Life is full of up and down
[00:22.48] I keep on searching for permanent security and satisfaction
[00:26.71] We sometimes get great achievement and encounter disappointment
[00:31.00] 不承不承なこの世界 ゆえに不条理 実に低迷
[00:35.67] それを黙ってやり過ごす
[00:37.90] そんな毎日とはおさらばバイバイ
[00:42.31] You kiss my ass!!
[00:45.28] Let's shake it down
[00:47.12] Get it up!
[00:48.19] What I am doing is what you're thinking now
[00:51.19] Everybody なにもかもとっぱらって
[00:55.21] Let's shake it down
[00:57.05] Get on up!
[00:58.64] まだまだこれから let's dance
[01:01.80] 型にははまらず you shake it down
[01:16.39] One day, the sun is shining
[01:19.17] It makes me feel alive and makes me so rash
[01:21.90] Another day, the sky is so dark
[01:23.88] I'm here crying alone looking down all the time
[01:26.84] 不承不承なこの世界 ゆえに不条理 実に低迷
[01:31.64] それを黙ってやり過ごす
[01:34.04] そんな毎日とはおさらばバイバイ
[01:36.64] I come from nowhere, I'm now here
[01:39.70] You know what I mean?
[01:40.67] Let's shake it down
[01:42.98] Get it up!
[01:44.05] What I am doing is what you're thinking now
[01:47.22] Everybody なにもかもとっぱらって
[01:51.08] Let's shake it down
[01:52.62] Get on up!
[01:54.44] まだまだこれから let's dance
[01:57.57] 型にはまらず shake it down
[02:15.70] This is your life 好きなように 騒いで我忘れて
[02:28.64] Let's shake it down
[02:31.11] Get it up!
[02:32.05] What I am doing is what you're thinking now
[02:34.81] Everybody なにもかもとっぱらって
[02:38.74] Let's shake it down
[02:41.15] Get on up!
[02:42.03] まだまだここから let's dance
[02:45.22] 横は気にせず you shake it down
[02:51.72] You shake it down
[02:55.03] Dooown!
