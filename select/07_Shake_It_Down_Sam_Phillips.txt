There's a pretty thing up on the shelf
You can't reach it by yourself
Close your eyes and let me
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it

When this town is closed up tight
You knock all day and walk all night
You don't have to force it
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it

If it's all up in your head
And never comes to bed
Raise your hands up
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it

When the spirit leaves you lost and weak
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it

Shake it, shake it down

Shake it, shake it
