The man from Japan says it's all a karma thrill
Before you can fly, you've gotta feel the chill
So if you dance all the way from the cradle to the grave
Well, you have to do it all again until your soul is saved

Where do I go from here?
There's gotta be a hole in the sky somewhere
I don't wanna come back 'round
I'm tired of being earthbound
Shake it down
You gotta make time to shake it
Shake it down
If at no time you're gonna make it
Shake it down
If you can't make it, fake it
Shake it down
All right
Shake it down

Philosophy will grow on trees if you just leave it alone
And love will often multiply 'cos you make more than you know

Where do I go from here?
There's gotta be a hole in the sky somewhere
I don't wanna come back 'round
I'm tired of being earthbound
Shake it down
You gotta make time to shake it
Shake it down
If at no time you're gonna make it
Shake it down
If you can't make it, fake it
Shake it down
All right
Shake it down

Hey, a soul can't be bought, nor can a soul be sold
'Cause it is just what it is, like a rose is just a rose
And if you dance all the way from the cradle to the grave
Well, you'll have to do it all again until your soul is saved

Where do I go from here?
There's gotta be a hole in the sky somewhere
I don't wanna come back 'round
I'm tired of being earthbound
Shake it down
You gotta make time to shake it
Shake it down
If at no time you're gonna make it
Shake it down
If you can't make it, fake it
Shake it down
All right
Shake it down
